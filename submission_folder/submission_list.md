Reason: This was the first server I ever moderated. I was given moderator on NR at the start of 2017 (my first mod) and loved it soo much. I really enjoy helping everyone aswell as keeping everyone safe - and getting rid of the trolls that join. I now have plenty of experience with moderation (mod on 8 servers, admin on 3 - none of those include my own) so I can react appropriately to almost any situation you can think of could happen to a server.
